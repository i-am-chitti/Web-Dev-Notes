__My Experience__: Suddenly, there was a power cut before the start of interview 3:30PM. I became a little nervous, and started telling answers quickly. Interview thought that I knew everything. I was so fast in speaking that my words weren't pronounced correctly. The interviewer was from Bihar and got my influence of mothertounge over pronounciation. He told me that I had enough knowledge and could easily crack the interviews but I should sit in good environment and speak slowly in the next round. His name was Snehansh Verma.

1. Go slowly. Speak clearly and confidently.
2. Start from physical layer and move to the top layer or vice versa during debugging the issue.

__Result__: Qualified for Round 3

## Round 3

4. What do you understand from the role for which you are applying for?

6. How checkdisk utility program present in Windows works?
7. What command is used to list processes in linux and what are the information you get in the output of the command?
8. Hypervisors and their types.

__My experience__: The interviewer didn't seem interested. He was doing some other work and there was a lot of pauses during the interview. He said that my resume matches more of a developer and since I have done a number of projects in web-development and a few in cybersecurity, why am I applying for a support role. Then, he went on justifying how support role people suffers from growth stagnation in long run and they only have two options, either to continue on same profile or go into consultation. I had to prove him that I was deeply motivated to work on support profile. So, I told him that I have studied Networking deeply and from a book called Computer Networks by Jeff Kuros and once, in my 2 year, I was searching for opportunity to give CCNA exam with college support. Anyhow, he was consistent on his words and lastly, told that I should be developer.

__Conclusion__: 
1. If you have done development projects, don't say any of them.
2. Don't reveal if you are working or having an offer letter of any firm.
3. Explain your points clearly and don't speak extra or add up something which even you might not be sure of. They are very experienced people in their domain. So, don't over mouth. Speak clearly and stick to the point.

__Result__: Rejected
