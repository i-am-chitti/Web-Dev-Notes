# Postman API

## Variables

A collection variable is tightly coupled with the collection and can only be used with that collection. On the other hand, environment variables can be used across many collections, in the same way you've stored your Postman API key in the same environment to be used with different collections.

Initial and current values: As you've learned from previous challenges, initial values may be accessible to others in a Team or Public workspace. Current values are local, and not synced or shared. Since we are working in a public workspace, it's very important to only add sensitive data to `CURRENT VALUE`
